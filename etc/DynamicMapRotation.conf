#?targetNbTeams:targetTeamSize:targetMinTeamSize:nbPlayers:currentNbTeams:currentTeamSize:startPosType|rotationMapList

#This plugin implements dynamic rotation map lists: the rotation map list is
#changed automatically depending on current battle context (number of players,
#number of teams, start position type...).
#The rules used to indicate which rotation map lists must be applied are defined
#in the configuration file named DynamicMapRotation.conf. The first rule
#matching current battle context is used to choose which map list to apply as
#current rotation list.
#A rather concrete example of configuration using a lot of different map lists
#is provided with this plugin. You can use it as a base to build your own rules,
#but you will need to define the corresponding map lists in your mapLists.conf
#file.
#As for all table-type SPADS configuration files, the first line is the full
#template declaration, which indicates all fields which can be used in your
#rules (these fields are explained in detail in the file header).
#Lines starting with "#?" are template definitions: they define which fields
#(and in which order) are used in the following rules declarations.
#When a rule contains an undefined field, it means it matches any value for this
#field.
